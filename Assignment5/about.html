    <h1>Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>

    <h2>Supreme's Website</h2>
    <p>Supreme has a bold design and mass following known for its simplictiy and appeal to younger audiences.</p>

    <h2>Family Feud</h2>
    <p>I find it interesting that even the craziest of things have established websites and I want to see what It's about.</p>

    <h2>Breaking Bad Store</h2>
    <p>I love Breaking Bad and i stumbled across their official website with tabs saying things like "sign in" and this got me very curious.</p>
